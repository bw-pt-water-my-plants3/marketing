        <div>We are normal people just like you who despite our best effots, have let more plants die than we can count. Each one more devastating than the last, we slowly became known as serial killers in the green thumb community. No more were we allowed at garden parties due to our negligence and perceived lack of empathy. The truth is, we were just so busy being awesome people with a plate so full of awesomeness that we seemingly forgot all about our green friends and they paid the ultimate price. We were sick of our never ending green graveyard controlling our lives so we started this project so we could never forget. Never again would our leafy companions suffer at the hands of our busy schedules. Never again will they wither away into the dry abyss. <br>
